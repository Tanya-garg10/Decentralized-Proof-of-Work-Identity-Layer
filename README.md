# Decentralized Proof-of-Work Identity Layer

A Web3-based system to verify real developer skills using GitHub & LeetCode activity, making portfolios tamper-proof, transparent, and trustworthy.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Today, resumes, certificates, and online portfolios can be easily exaggerated or manipulated. Recruiters and hackathon organizers struggle to verify whether a candidate’s skills and contributions are genuine.

This project solves that problem by creating a **decentralized proof-of-work identity layer** that:

- Fetches real coding activity from GitHub & LeetCode  
- Analyzes contribution patterns  
- Generates a skill score  
- Stores verified profiles on blockchain for transparency  

## 🎯 Problem Statement

- Fake certificates and inflated resumes are common  
- GitHub/LeetCode alone don’t show real skill depth  
- No secure, tamper-proof verification system exists  


## 💡 Solution

Our platform provides:

1. **Automated Proof-of-Work Scanner**  
   Fetches real coding activity from GitHub & LeetCode.

2. **Authenticity Analysis**  
   Analyzes commit history and consistency.

3. **Skill Growth Dashboard**  
   Visualizes real progress using charts.

4. **Blockchain Verification**  
   Stores verified profiles on Polygon testnet.
